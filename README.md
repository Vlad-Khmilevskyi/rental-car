##

####
Seamless Navigation: Our app boasts a user-friendly interface with three primary sections - Home, Catalog, and Favorites, all seamlessly connected through intuitive routing.
####
Home Sweet Home: Upon landing on the Home page, you'll discover an all-encompassing overview of our top-notch car rental services. We'll outline what makes us stand out and why choosing ExploreCar for your car rental needs is a decision you won't regret.
####
Catalog of Dreams: The Catalog page is your treasure trove of available vehicles. Scroll through an impressive lineup of cars and, with just a tap of the "Load More" button, reveal even more options. Once you've reached the end of our catalog, rest assured that the button will discreetly vanish, signifying that you've explored all available choices.
####
Favorites at Your Fingertips: Each car card in our Catalog features a heart-shaped button for your convenience. Simply tap it to add your desired vehicle to your Favorites. This nifty feature simplifies keeping track of the cars you're eyeing. The Favorites page is your personal garage, storing all the car cards you've marked as favorites for quick and easy access, making comparisons a breeze.
####
Smart Filtering: Both the Catalog and Favorites pages offer a range of filter collections, designed to simplify your search. Filter cars by brand, price per hour, or car mileage in kilometers, ensuring you find the perfect match for your adventure.
####
User-Friendly Alerts: To enhance your experience, we've integrated error notifications through toast messages. These alerts will keep you informed about any input or search errors, guaranteeing a seamless journey. And if you wish to embark on a fresh search, a reset button is readily available to clear your filters and start anew.
##
No Cars, No Worries: On the Favorites page, if you haven't yet added any cars to your favorites, you'll encounter a friendly message stating, "No cars available." This serves as a gentle reminder to save your cherished vehicles for future reference.
